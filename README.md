# Libasm

An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is a low-level programming
language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong
(but often not one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architecture’s
machine code instructions. Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer
architecture. In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable
across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling. Assembly language
may also be called symbolic machine code.

## Mandatory part

• The library must be called libasm.a.

• You must submit a main that will test your functions and that will compile with
your library to show that it’s functional.

• You must rewrite the following functions in asm:
◦ ft_strlen (man 3 strlen)
◦ ft_strcpy (man 3 strcpy)
◦ ft_strcmp (man 3 strcmp)
◦ ft_write (man 2 write)
◦ ft_read (man 2 read)
◦ ft_strdup (man 3 strdup, you can call to malloc)

• You must check for errors during syscalls and properly set them when needed.

• Your code must set the variable errno properly.

• For that, you are allowed to call the extern ___error
